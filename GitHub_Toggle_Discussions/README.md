# GitHub Toggle Discussions #

If you use GitHub pull requests for code reviews, you might find this userscript useful:

![GitHub Toggle Discussions screenshot](https://github.com/MichaelTamm/userscripts/raw/master/GitHub_Toggle_Discussions/screenshot.png)

(1) Whenever the conversation page of a pull request is displayed, a little check mark
is added to each discussion. (A discussion is started, when a reviewer makes a comment.)
You can click on the check mark to collapse/expand a discussion.

(2) Furthermore, if you are the author of the last comment in a discussion, the check mark
is colored green and the discussion is automatically collapsed, when the page loads. So you
see only those discussions, which need an answer by you.
